# Label Planktonic Images
The aim of this repository is to create a user-friendly interface that facilitates the labeling of planktonic images.
This is done by listing the images in a folder and allowing the end-user to label each image with the corresponding plankton-taxa.
Labeling can be from a list of predefined labels (autocomplete)
or if the class label doesn't exist the end-user will be allowed to enter a new label.
The end-result will be saved in a csv file image name along with its label.
